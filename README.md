# PixelateFilter
It was one of assignment of optional courses *- Parallel Computing with GPUs* during my second term in Sheffield University. 
The project was implementating a simple pixelate filter on a photografic image input with any size and producing its 
photo mosaic by averaging RGB colour values of the image. The goal of it was understanding and analysing the efficency of the
programme with different design and executive ways.
