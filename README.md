# PixelateFilter
It was one of assignment of optional courses *- Parallel Computing with GPUs* during my second term in Sheffield University. 
The project was to implement a simple pixelate filter on a photografic image input with any size and then produced its 
photo mosaic by averaging RGB colour values of the image cells through C language. How to understand and analyse the efficency of the
programme with different design ways and executive modes, such as multiple threads or OpenMP on CPU and CUDA on GPU, were the main goal.

## Requirements
